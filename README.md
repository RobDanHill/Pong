# Pong
My attempt at creating Pong, using Ken Silverman's Evaldraw software.
##### About the project:
- Pong is like the "hello world" program of graphics programmers.

- I felt it was necessary for me to attempt a simple Pong clone because it covers so many fundamental concepts of both graphics and logic.
